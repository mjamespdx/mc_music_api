Data from a BeautifulSoup-based Metacritic API

Currently, it pulls user and metacritic rankings from the first 10 pages of the all-time top user ranked albums, as well as the genre from each album's page. These data are temporarily written to a csv file.

Future plans include hosting the API on AWS for use with a public dashboard.
